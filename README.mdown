How to use
----------

* Copy class files into your project
* Add QuartzCore.framework to your project's linked libraries

Changes to the original ALToastView from Alex Leutg√∂b
-----------------------------------------------------

* Updated for ARC
* Only one ToastView is shown at a time (no queue)
* If a new ToastView is created while another is active, the old will be removed instantly
* If a new ToastView is created with the same text, the timer will start again
